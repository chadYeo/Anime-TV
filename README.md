Implementation:


Apollo GraphQL Client for Android (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) - Apollo-Android is a GraphQL compliant client that generates Java models from standard GraphQL queries. These models give you a typesafe API to work with GraphQL servers. Apollo will help you keep your GraphQL query statements together, organized, and easy to access from Java. 





# Baking App: Udacity (Android Devloper Nanodegree)

<body>
  <h3>Project Summary</h3>
  <p>This is an Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
  I created an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located here (http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images for this app. 
Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills I demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in my data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.</p>
  
  <h3>This App:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.</li>
      <li>Handled error cases in Android.</li>
      <li>Added a widget to this app experience.</li>
      <li>Leveraged a third-party library in this app.</li>
      <li>Used Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Source:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Android RecyclerView (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-RecyclerView): RecyclerView can display large datasets that can be scrolled efficiently by recycling a limited number of views.</li>
  <li>ExoPlayer (https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer): ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet.</li>
